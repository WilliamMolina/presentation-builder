# Presentation Builder
A simplistic way to build stunning presentations with speed using Reveal.js and Docker.

To get started, clone this repo, modify the `input/slides.md` file to define your slides and place your referenced resources in `input/res/`.

To view your slides or present, run `present.sh`.  This will ultimately build your presentation and open your default browser to serve your presentation.
